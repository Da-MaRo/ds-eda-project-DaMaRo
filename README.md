# Real Estate EDA Project

## Overview

This project was part of the Data Science Bootcamp at neuefische GmbH and focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) for real estate investments, specifically for the seller Bonnie Williams. The goal is to identify optimal investment strategies based on neighborhood trends, demand, and renovation potential.

## Objectives

1. **Analyze Neighborhood Trends**: Identify districts that are gaining popularity and attracting investment.
2. **Assess Demand**: Determine areas with high demand for housing, particularly where property prices are relatively low.
3. **Identify Renovation Opportunities**: Find older properties that can be purchased and renovated for a higher return on investment.

## Data Sources

- **Property Listings**: Data on various properties owned by Bonnie Williams, including location, price, condition, and occupancy status.
- **Market Trends**: Historical data on property prices, investment levels, and neighborhood growth.
- **Demographics**: Information on population growth, income levels, and other demographic factors influencing housing demand.

## Methodology

### 1. Data Collection and Cleaning

- Gather data from multiple sources, including property listings, market trends, and demographics.
- Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and errors.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

- Perform statistical analysis and visualizations to understand the distribution and patterns in the data.
- Use clustering techniques to identify trending districts and areas with high demand.
- Analyze the condition and age of properties to spot renovation opportunities.

### 3. Recommendations

Based on the EDA, I provide the following investment recommendations for Bonnie Williams:

#### Invest in Trendy Districts

- **Rationale**: Investing in areas where others are already investing can lead to significant returns as these districts are likely to continue growing in popularity.
- **Approach**: Identify districts with increasing investment and property value trends. Monitor ongoing development projects and community improvements.

#### Invest in High Demand, Low-Cost Districts

- **Rationale**: Areas with high housing demand but relatively low property prices offer great potential for profitable investments.
- **Approach**: Focus on districts with high occupancy rates, rising population, and economic growth. Look for properties that are priced below the market average.

#### Find and Renovate Old Houses

- **Rationale**: Renovating older houses can increase their value significantly, leading to substantial returns on investment.
- **Approach**: Identify properties in need of renovation that are located in desirable areas. Calculate the potential return on investment by considering renovation costs and expected market value post-renovation.

## Results/Output

- **Trendy Districts Identified**: Several districts showing a consistent increase in investment and property values.
- **High Demand Areas**: Districts with high occupancy rates and affordable housing prices pinpointed.
- **Renovation Targets**: Specific properties identified as high potential for renovation and resale.

## Conclusion

By following the outlined strategies, Bonnie Williams can maximize her investment returns. The recommendations are based on thorough data analysis and are aimed at identifying lucrative opportunities in the real estate market and were showcased in a 10 minute presentation .
